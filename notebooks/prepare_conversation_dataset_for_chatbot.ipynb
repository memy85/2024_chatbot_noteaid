The diffuse superimposed beta frequency activity is \\nmost likely \\ndue to treatment with benzodiazepines. Note is made of an \\nirregularly \\nirregular cardiac rhythm consistent with the patient's history \\nof atrial \\nfibrillation. \\n\\n___ EEG:\\nIMPRESSION: There were no clinical seizures during this session. \\n\\nHowever, there is a very active interictal epileptic disturbance \\nover \\nthe left temporal region along with a slow wave focus in that \\narea \\nsuggestive of a subcortical structural lesion. There is mild \\ndiffuse \\nbackground slowing which seemed to improve as the study \\nprogressed into \\nthe following morning. \\n\\n___ EEG:\\nIMPRESSION: This prolonged continuous video EEG shows focal slow \\nwaves \\nover the left temporal region compatible with a structural \\nlesion along \\nwith paroxysmal interictal epileptiform activity from the same \\nregion. \\nThe background rhythm seemed stable but better developed over \\nthe right \\nhemisphere and there continues to be a cardiac rhythm \\ndisturbance. \\n\\n___ EEG:\\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG because of \\nfocal \\nleft temporal slowing with epileptiform discharges phase \\nreversing at \\nF7, indicative of an area of focal epileptogenic cortex as well \\nas \\nunderlying subcortical dysfunction. The discharges did not \\nappear \\nperiodic or repetitive to suggest ongoing seizures. There was \\none \\npushbutton activation for patient hitting the bed rail with her \\nright \\nhand but there was no electrographic correlate. The background \\nremains \\nlow voltage and slow indicative of a moderate to severe \\nencephalopathy. \\nNo clear electrographic seizures were seen. \\n\\nECG:\\nAtrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Low limb \\nlead voltage. Late R wave progression. Minor T wave \\nabnormalities. Since the previous tracing ___ the rate is \\nfaster. Voltage is lower. T wave abnormalities are more \\nprominent. Clinical correlation is suggested.  \\n  Intervals Axes \\nRate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T \\n121 0 74 ___ \\n \\n1 view CXR:\\nIMPRESSION: Limited due to low lung volumes without definite \\nsigns of \\npneumonia or overt CHF. \\n\\nHead and Neck CTA and CTP with and without contrast:\\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Atypical diffusely decreased mean transit time, increased \\nvolume and \\nblood flow to the left cerebral hemisphere which could reflect \\nhyperperfusion. \\n2. No evidence of infarct or other acute intracranial pathology. \\nNo vascular occlusion. \\n\\nMRI Head with and without contrast:\\nIMPRESSION: Subtle hyperintensity in the posterior portion of \\nthe left \\nthalamus could be due to remote infarct and is not typical for a \\nneoplastic process. No abnormal enhancement is seen. However, \\ngiven the subtle nature of the abnormality, followup study \\nincluding coronal T2-weighted images should be obtained in four \\nto six weeks. No acute infarcts are seen. \\n\\nCXR - 1 view:\\n1. Interval placement of a feeding tube, which courses below the \\ndiaphragm \\nwith the tip likely within the stomach. The patient is markedly \\nrotated to \\nthe right, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal \\ncontours.  \\nOverall, however, there is a more focal airspace opacity in the \\nleft mid and lower lung, which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary \\nedema or an infectious process, less likely atelectasis. \\nClinical correlation is advised.

There \\nwas no obvious source identified, but given her profound \\nneutropenia (admission ANC 160), she was pancultured and \\ninitiated on vancomycin/cefepime. On ___, the patient noted \\nmild \"right sinus congestion.\" Pt reports history of sinus \\ninfections and also seasonal allergies. Review of systems \\notherwise negative and exam unremarkable. CT scan of the sinus \\ndid not show evidence of an acute sinusitis. Vancomycin was \\ndiscontinued after 48 hours and cefepime was discontinued after \\n72 hours. Pt was monitored for 24 hours on oral antibiotics \\n(home ciprofloxacin) prior to discharge. Etiology of the fever \\nremains unknown. Differential includes infection (viral > \\nbacterial), reaction to either the chemotherapy or platelet \\ntransfusion, or her underlying malignancy. \\n\\n# Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Relapse\\n# Pancytopenia\\n(complex cytogenetics + TP53 deletion, FLT3 ITD negative)\\nPer outpatient note from ___: Patient received 4 cycles of \\nDacogen induction followed by RIC MUD AlloSCT with \\nFlu/Bu/ATG/MTX while in CR1. Downtrending plts concerning for \\nrelapse around D+100 and BMBX on ___ consistent with \\nrelapsed disease with ___ blasts on core and complex \\nkaryotype including p53 deletion present at initial diagnosis. \\nThe plan was to start Decitabine the following week to allow for \\nher counts to recover in addition to tapering her Tacrolimus \\nlevel. As noted, patient presented to the hospital on ___ with a \\nlow grade fever (100.4) and muscle aches after receiving her \\nfirst dose of Decitabine (cycle 2, day 1 of 5) and a platelet \\ntransfusion. She was treated for neutropenic fever (see above) \\nand continued cycle 2 of Decitabine (day 5 of 5 on ___. Her \\ntacrolimus was tapered from 0.5mg 5x/week to 0.5mg every other \\nday. Her peripheral blast percentage was 9% on admission, peaked \\nto 11% and was down to 8% at discharge. \\n\\n# Pancytopenia\\nSecondary to chemotherapy and relapse of AML. She required 1 \\nunit of red cells on admission for a hemoglobin of 6.4. She was \\ncontinued on her Acyclovir, Bactrim and Posaconazole; \\nCiprofloxacin held while on Cefepime and restarted prior to \\ndischarge. \\n\\n# Knee pain, acute on chronic\\nPt with history of right knee trauma. Since then, she has \\nintermittent flares of pain and swelling. This usually resolves \\nwith ice, a knee brace and acetaminophen or low dose oxycodone. \\nOvernight on ___, the patient developed similar but slightly \\nmore severe right knee pain, worse with flexion and when \\nwalking. At this time, she was also noted to have a temperature \\nof 99.2 but was otherwise asymptomatic. Her knee had mild \\nswelling along the right lateral aspect but exam was otherwise \\nunremarkable. Her pain resolved with one dose of oxycodone and \\nstabilization with her knee brace. The decision was made to \\ndefer further work up given the chronicity of the pain and that \\nfact that she looked and felt well from every other aspect. \\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\\n# Hypertension\\nThe patient\\'s home amlodipine on was held on admission. Earlier \\nin her course her systolic pressures remained between 100s-120s. \\nPrior to discharge, her blood pressures ranged between 120-140s. \\nWill restart amlodipine on day after discharge. \\n\\n# Elevated creatinine\\nPer OMR, creatinine level fluctuates, with intermittent \\nelevations between 1.1-1.4. Baseline creatinine appears to be \\ncloser to 0.8-1.0. During this admission, her creatinine ranged \\nbetween 1.0-1.2. Nephrotoxins were avoided including contrast or \\nNSAIDs.\\n\\n# History of cavernous sinus thrombosis: MRI on ___ \\nconsistent with subacute venous sinus thrombosis. Neurosurgery \\nrecommended systemic anticoagulation to prevent propagation of \\nthe filling defect which is likely due to meningioma. She was \\ninitiated on therapeutic enoxaparin. This has been held since \\n___ secondary to platelet count less than 50,000.\\n\\n# History of left parietal meningioma: asymptomatic, followed by \\n\\nDr. ___ neuro-oncology as well as Dr. ___ \\nneurosurgery.\\nMeningioma thought to be slow growing and no urgent intervention \\nis needed at this time. Will likely undergo surgical excision \\nfollowing treatment of leukemia.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\\nCode status: Full (presumed)\\nAccess: tunnel line (right subclavian, heparin-dependent)\\nContact(s): \\n1. ___ (HCP), friend - ___\\n2. ___, friend - ___ \\n3. ___ (next of kin) - ___ \\nDischarge CBC: WBC 0.9, Hb 7.7, Plt 18\\nDischarge ANC: 230\\nDischarge peripheral blast percentile: 8%\\nDischarge creatinine: 1.0\\n\\n- Acute Myeloid Leukemia\\n[] Continue to wean Tacrolimus: 0.5mg 5x/week decreased to every \\nother day on ___ (held on ___, next dose on ___\\n\\n- Acute on chronic right knee pain\\n[] Assess degree of swelling and mobility of her knee in clinic\\n\\n- History of cavernous sinus thrombosis\\n[] Plan to restart Lovenox once platelet count recovers >50k\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\\n1.

You were also \\ntransfused 1 unit of red blood cells during your \\nhospitalization. \\n\\nAs mentioned above, your immune system is very weak right now \\nwhile you are undergoing treatment. Therefore, please follow a \\nstrict diet (called a neutropenic diet).
