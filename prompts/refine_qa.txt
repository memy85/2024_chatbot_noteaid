Please fix this and output a json so that it could be converted to json in python using json.loads. Please output the json and nothing else.

[
{{"question" : "what is your discharge diagnosis?",
"choices" : {{
	"a" : "...",
	"b" : "...",
	"c" : "..."}},
"answer" : "a",
}},
{{"question" : "what is medication A for?",
"choices" : {{
	"a" : "...",
	"b" : "...",
	"c" : "..."}},
"answer" : "b",
}}
...
]
